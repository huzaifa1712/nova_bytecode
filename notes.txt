1. by default parse if as a statement (inside declaration)
2. but inside expression also allow if as a possibility + add if as prefix
3. when if is a statement: OpPop at the end if the last value was an expression
4. if (true) { 2 } on its own should be disallowed => returns expr
    -> set is_stmt=false when return



if (true) {
    2
} else {
    print(3);
}
// should be disallowed because else last is_stmt and if last is expr

how to check whether last value was an expr or stmt
